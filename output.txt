St. Petersburg is happy to be the home of the unique «optical-computer science» University. Such a combination of popular sciences draws a lot of attention both from our international partners and many domestic companies to the University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics. Moreover, during turbulent year of reforms in our country, the unique knowledge base and competence helped our university to continue and develop academic and research activities.

One hundred years of tireless work of several generations of professors, lecturers and staff have brought our university a well-deserved success. We grew from a skill/vocational school that opened in 1900 into the Leningrad Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics (LITMO) (1933), progressing to the University status we received in 1994, and last but not the least in 2011 we were named St. Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics.

I am pleased to say that the university can be proud not only of its impressive hundred-year history but also of the major results achieved in the last decade.
